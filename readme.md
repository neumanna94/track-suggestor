## Description

_{This project utilized radial buttons to pass their specific ids into functions that added each tracks individual sum by the relative weight given to each selection. There is no survey choice that does not affect the result. Furthermore we are able to apply any equation to describe the weight given towards a survey selection to one of our chosen outcomes. Furthermore, we store the 7 field question as an array, and then pass that array into an all fields array. This later on should all the ability to apply statistics to our users information. ALlowing more personalized web styling and furthermore a deeper understanding of the users of our website.}_

## Technologies Used

_{HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap. I used nested functions and built-in array sort method to track the highest weighted class recommendation.Furthermore I then found the second most weighted class and also displayed information for it as well. With the current set-up it is possible to in the future to create a file that a function can read to change the weights of each survey question as we go. The goal being the statistics function of our JavaScript can autocorrect our weights as students re-survey the satisfaction with the class they took.}_
